## README - Initial Trials

This folder contains the initial trial adaptations of [Harris's N-body simulation implementation](https://github.com/harrism/mini-nbody/tree/master). Additionally, the simulated galaxy initialization in these trials refers to methods used in [Uriot's Galaxy Simulation project](https://github.com/angeluriot/Galaxy_simulation).

These files represent the early stages of experimentation within the project.

### Videos
Included in this folder are two simulation videos generated during the initial trials, with the initial particle velocities set to 0.
